# FreeCodeCamp challenges solutions

Free code camp doesn't save your solutions so I keep them in a folder and push them here from time to time. Just to have it somewhere if I ever need to revisit them. Will be interesting to look at in a few years and see if my coding instincts improved. I am doing the challenges mostly for fun, so most of these are the first working solution I came up with, definitely not the most optimal.
